1. Project Title is Thentic Dapp

2. Project Description
This is a simple Dapp built on HTML and javascript. The project uses Thentic API to create NFT contracts, mint and transfer NFTs.
Some challenges I faced is to learn how to use API in development. In future I hope to create more beautiful and appealing user interface using modern libraries like React. But the functionality works just fine. This project is built for BSC Testnet.
